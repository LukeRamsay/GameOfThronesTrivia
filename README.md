The app needed to do the Following:
1. Display categories
2. Display questions
3. Allow users to answer questions

# Shortcomings
I had to complete this project in about a day because im an idiot who doesnt backup his work or use git often (lesson learnt) I got prety much back to where I was before in terms of functionality but I really would have liked to work on my styling more to get it back to where it was and I also really could've used the time I spent recreating everything to add in extra functionality like custom fonts, sounds, animations and a name system/scoreboard. Despite this im still pretty happy that I managed to finish this project and meet the requirements on the brief and Ill probably still work on this project a bit in the future.
